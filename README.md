## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a **Data Analysis & Research Executive** with hands-on success in turning business data into revenue-driving insights. I specialize in **Python**, **SQL**, and **Power BI**, with a strong focus on **psychographic analytics**, **data storytelling**, and **AI-based systems**.

💼 I bring a **unique edge** to data work — thanks to my background as a **Sales Manager** and **Business Development Officer**. I’ve directly led sales operations, increased revenue by over 105%, and built pricing tools that close deals faster. I don’t just analyze data — I know how to use it to **sell smarter and scale faster**.

🤖 I'm passionate about **Artificial Intelligence**, and love working on AI-powered models that uncover behavior, personalize experiences, and help businesses grow.

🚀 As a Computer Engineer, I combine technical depth with business instinct — delivering **automated systems**, **dashboards**, and **predictive models** that actually get results.

> 💬 **Better Call Beep!** Whether you're selling products or scaling platforms — I can build you the insights to do it better.
